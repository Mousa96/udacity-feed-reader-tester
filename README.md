# udacity-feed-reader-tester
## Testing with Javascript with the help of Jasmine
### Project Description from the official project page

We are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in

#### How To Run
I would include a live version but for some reason it behaves differently from the local version and the specs aren't showing, so for now you can clone the repo and open index.html
